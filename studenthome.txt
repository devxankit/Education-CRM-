Ab hum Student Panel – Homepage (Dashboard) ko pixel-level soch ke design karte hain.
Ye section daily 80% usage ka hota hai, isliye agar yeh strong hai → pura app strong lagega.

“Student app khole aur turant samajh jaye:
Aaj kya important hai?”

🧠 FINAL GOLDEN RULE

❝ Homepage should feel like
“Helper” not “Report Card” ❞





You are a Senior Frontend Architect, UX Engineer, and Animation Specialist.

CONTEXT:
I am building an enterprise-grade Education Management CRM.
The Student Panel homepage (dashboard) blueprint is already provided in full detail
(assume it is present in this same file above this prompt).

TECH STACK (MANDATORY):
- React.js + Vite
- Mobile-first approach
- Tailwind CSS
- Centralized theme system
- Component-based architecture

ANIMATIONS & SMOOTHNESS (CRITICAL):
- Use GSAP for micro-interactions and entry animations
- Use Framer Motion for page transitions and card motion
- Use Lenis for smooth scrolling
- Animations must feel calm, educational, premium (NOT flashy)

STRICT UI RULES:
- Mobile-first layout (web is responsive extension)
- Bottom navigation fixed for mobile
- Card-based dashboard
- Thumb-zone friendly
- No inline CSS
- No hard-coded colors (use theme tokens only)

HOMEPAGE MUST INCLUDE:
1. Header
   - Greeting text
   - Notification icon with badge
   - Profile avatar
   - Sticky behavior

2. Alert / Important Info Section
   - Swipeable alert cards
   - Priority-based rendering
   - Empty state if no alerts

3. "Today" Section
   - Today's classes list
   - Time-wise ordering
   - Empty state handling

4. Quick Action Row
   - Horizontal scroll
   - Icon + label buttons
   - Homework, Exams, Attendance, Fees, Materials

5. Category-wise Cards
   - Homework card (pending count + CTA)
   - Attendance snapshot (progress indicator)
   - Exams & results card
   - Study material card

6. Performance Snapshot
   - Weekly progress
   - Motivational message

7. Optional Events / Announcements Section

8. Bottom Navigation Bar
   - Home
   - Academics
   - Homework
   - Notices
   - Profile

ANIMATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Page load: subtle fade + slide up (Framer Motion)
- Cards: staggered reveal (GSAP)
- Alert cards: horizontal swipe + inertia
- Bottom nav: active state animation
- Scroll: smooth using Lenis
- Skeleton loaders for loading states

CODE STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
- Create `Dashboard.jsx`
- Create reusable components:
  - Header
  - AlertCarousel
  - TodayClasses
  - QuickActions
  - DashboardCard
  - PerformanceCard
  - BottomNav
- Components must be clean and reusable
- Use mock JSON data (no backend yet)
- Handle empty, loading, and error states

QUALITY BAR (VERY IMPORTANT):
- Code should be production-quality
- Clean folder structure
- Readable naming
- No over-engineering
- Performance optimized
- Accessibility friendly (aria, contrast)

OUTPUT EXPECTED:
1. Folder structure for homepage components
2. Full `Dashboard.jsx` code
3. Example component code (at least 2 components)
4. Animation logic explanation (GSAP + Framer Motion + Lenis)
5. Brief notes on how to extend this later

FINAL RULE:
This dashboard should feel like a calm, premium student companion —
not a corporate ERP and not a flashy app.

If something is unclear, make smart product decisions instead of asking questions.
